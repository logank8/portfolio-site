<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a student at University of British Columbia, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I will be graduating in <b>May 2025</b>! I am looking for full-time work anywhere in Canada starting after my graduation.

I have experience in designing and building websites in a variety of development environments. I mainly work with either WordPress or React.js + HTML + CSS. I also have a strong interest in game development, especially game graphics, and have been working to learn more about optimizing rendering within a game engine. I believe in detailed and accessible code documentation and an iterative work flow to ensure highest quality.

Note: this website contains the highlights of my experience and what I consider to be the most relevant. If you are interested in a fuller list of everything I am familiar with or you want more information on my past work, you can download my resume here:
